# My Notes App

This project is a simple note-taking application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It allows users to create, save, and manage their notes locally within the browser.

## Features

**Functionality:**

* **Create Notes:** Users can input text into a designated area to create new notes.
* **Save Notes:**  Notes are saved locally in the browser's storage (likely using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`).  This means notes are preserved even after the browser is closed and reopened.  *Note: This implementation likely doesn't persist beyond browser clearing.*
* **Display Notes:**  Saved notes are displayed on the page, allowing users to review them.  (Likely with a mechanism to list and possibly view each individual note).
* **(Potentially) Delete Notes:** The application may include functionality to delete individual notes.

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML (index.html):**
    * `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, `<textarea>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` (or similar elements) for structuring the page content and providing input/output areas.  Specific elements will depend on the design.
    * Possibly uses `div` elements for structuring sections of the page.

* **CSS (styles.css):**
    * Styling using selectors (like class selectors `.class-name` and ID selectors `#id-name`) to control the appearance of elements.
    * Likely uses properties like `font-family`, `color`, `background-color`, `padding`, `margin`, `width`, `height`, `display`, `flex`, and `grid` for layout and visual design.  
    * Potentially uses CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) or pre-built CSS libraries. This would need to be confirmed by inspecting the `styles.css` file.

* **JavaScript (script.js):**
    * Event listeners (`addEventListener`) are used to handle user interactions such as creating, saving, and deleting notes.  
    * DOM manipulation (using methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, etc.) to dynamically update the page content based on user actions.
    * Local storage (`localStorage` or `sessionStorage`) is used for persistent storage of notes.
    * Functions are defined to encapsulate note creation, saving, loading, and deletion logic.  
    * Potentially uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to structure and store the note data efficiently.


## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file.
* `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the application logic.


## Further Improvements (Potential Future Additions)

* **Persistent Storage:** Implement a more robust storage solution (like IndexedDB or a backend server) to ensure data persistence beyond browser clearing.
* **Note Editing:** Add functionality to edit existing notes.
* **Search Functionality:**  Allow users to search for notes containing specific keywords.
* **Enhanced UI:** Improve the user interface for a more polished and user-friendly experience.


This README provides a general overview.  The specifics of the implementation will depend on the content of the provided `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files.
